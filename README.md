## Development

To start app with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/):

```sh
docker compose up --watch # --watch requires Docker Compose >=2.22.0
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000

Container will automatically rebuild on file changes. Refresh the browser to view changes to the application.
